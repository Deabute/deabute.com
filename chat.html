<p>This is a test of webRTC data channels that allows for texting with a friend.
    You will need to share an "offer" with a friend (ironically via another messaging solution),
    and they should share an "answer" with you or vise versa.
    By sharing these two peices of information,
    your browsers can find a peer to peer connection with one another to start a text chat</p>
<br>
<button onclick="rtc.getOffer()" type="button" name="getInfo">Get Offer</button>
<br>
<p id=offerAnswerResults> offer or answer to copy to friend will show up here<p>
<br>
