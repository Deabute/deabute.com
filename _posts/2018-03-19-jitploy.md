This outlines the goals of Jitploy. A product that addresses issues of deploying software services in a rapid and competitive way without sacrificing stability and sustainability of the service.

### Problem

Have you had a critical fix or feature take way too long to get to production?

This is the initial problem statement that Jitploy looks to answer. In the past few years traditional infrastructure has slowly been abstracted away into software layers so teams can focus on more specific business problems than just the problems of managing systems. "In progress" is a phrase worth highlighting. The hardware and deployment pipeline is only in progress of being abstracted industry wide. Many times its happening internally in the absence of provided solutions. Given the gaps and given the fact that servers still exist somewhere operations automation task are now on the onus of the developer. This takes attention away from core business goals. Having the exact opposite affect desired. Unless your company delivers infrastructure managing it is likely outside the core business. So we are still managing infrastructure! Instead of an IT or OPS its developers managing the infrastructure through software.

"It would be great to just focus as much as possible on my company's core business"

### Immediate Versioned Deployment

Jitploy deploys services based on a push to a source control branch. With little setup time and ability to federate deployments to internal and customer provisioned services. Operations task are abstracted away and exist as service configuration files within the repository. The important detail is that environment and configuration is setup per service and managed with in that service's repository. Environment variables are encrypted with a shared key that is used when setting the service up. Benefit is all aspects of a running service can be versioned in a singular repository and those keys can be disclosed to the end operator or developer per environment. It gives them a complete view of the working service in a central place. With jitploy push to a branch, that branch can deploy a specific environment or many. This is immediate versioned deployment, makes rolling back as easy as reverting to a previous commit and pushing. Knowing how to use the version control system is knowing how to use Jitploy. In this way hot fixes in mission critical situations are moments away and integration test can still run off of development specific branches in parallel instead of in line. Develop when its time to develop, test when its time to test, deploy when its time to deploy, and fix when its time to fix. The suggestion here is small modular services to increase deployment velocity, but it can be as modular or monolithic as the developer likes.

### How does it work?

 `Note: Currently one can sign up as interested and depending on access situation to the beta product might be available with a subset of the features described above and below`

Jitploy can be setup by registering a github webhook or similar event from the service's master version control repository. Once the hook is created, the Jitploy client can be installed on the target run and development environments. Jitploy's node client just needs a clear ssl path to connect with its host server that listens to and determines the authenticity of webhook events from source control. The client on the development machine is used to encrypt a yml configuration file that holds the environment variables. Using the Jitploy lock command with an environment option creates an encrypted configuration file that can be safely committed to version control. The client on the deploy target needs to be setup with the desired, repository, environment, and lock key for that environment. This key is automatically generated and found in the untracked decrypted_env.yml file on the development machine. This process establishes a shared key to decrypt info between the dev machine and the deployment target. Important for versioned configuration. Also a connection that listens for version control events is made on the deployment target.

The plan is that infrastructure based configuration will be possible with an applicable plan that has a preset cost.

At the time of this write up some of these features are in progress and a how to guide is in the works. In the mean time express interest in the survey below.

### The Moonshot

Goal X. Live in a world where entry level developers sign up for jitploy use a provided provisioning template to write some basic code and deploy their first hello world to the real world

Goal Y. Live in a world where new a new contributer can hit the floor running furthering a projects aspirations.

Goal Z. Live in a world all running services are evolving and keep up to date in an automated way with a modest effort on the part of the maintainer
